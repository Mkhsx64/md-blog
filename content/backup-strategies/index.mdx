# Backup Strategies
#### 3-2-1-1 Backup Rule
The original 3-2-1 backup strategy was conceived before the internet era and is perfectly sufficient in most scenarios. However, in recent years, this approach has been expanded to the 3-2-1-1 backup rule in response to the cyberthreat landscape and data compliance requirements. The 3-2-1-1 backup strategy:

-   Keep at least **three (3)** copies of your data.
-   Store **two (2)** backup copies on different storage media.
-   Store **one (1)** copy offsite.
-   Create **one (1)** immutable or air-gapped backup copy.

###### Immutable backups
- Are backup files stored using the write-once-read-many (WORM) model. 
- Cannot be modified or deleted making them immune to ransomware attacks or accidental or intentional deletion.
- Examples: immutable storage can be configured on Linux OS based machines, or in the cloud like AWS with S3 object lock feature.

###### Runbook Automation
- Is a system whereby procedures to be carried out regularly to maintain performance within computer systems.
- Automating the runbook process of completing the runbook without manual input increasing efficiency and reliability.
